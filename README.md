# Communication Map based on the single-cell RNA-sequencing data

ComMap builds an inter-cellular communication map (Interactome) based
on the scRNA-seq data and pathway enrichment.

## Credits and special thanks

1. An intra-cellular interactome (signalling) is from [SigHotSpotter](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/6/1963/5614427)

2. Ligand-Receptor interaction were collected by PhD candidates (31.08.2020) Kartikeya Singh and Chrysovalantou Kalaitzidou at
University of Luxembourg.

3. Ligand-Receptor matching using mean-field approximation was written by Sascha Jung (Center of Excellence Severo Ochoa, Bilbao, Spain).
